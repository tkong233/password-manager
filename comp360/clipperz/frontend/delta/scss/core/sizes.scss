Bootstrap CSS suggests these size breakpoints:

- Extra small devices Phones (<768px)
- Small devices Tablets (≥768px)
- Medium devices Desktops (≥992px)
- Large devices Desktops (≥1200px)


# ATTENTION
When adding a new 'size', remember to update also MQ.init invocation in main.js.
This configuration is now located in the first script included in the index_template.html file.
