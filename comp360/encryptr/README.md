Encryptr

### [https://spideroak.com/solutions/encryptr](https://spideroak.com/solutions/encryptr)

[Encryptr](https://spideroak.com/solutions/encryptr) is a zero-knowledge, cloud-based e-wallet / password manager powered by Crypton.

Encryptr keeps it simple. It has three types of data it can store. Passwords, Credit Card numbers and general key/value pairs. It can easily be expanded to include other default entry types.

It is currently working on Android, iOS, and the Desktop â€“ thanks to [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js).

## Requirements

- Node and npm - [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/)
	- Node package manager for the Cordova CLI and Grunt
- Cordova CLI - [https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/)
	- Cordova / PhoneGap command line interface
  - `npm install -g cordova`
- Grunt - [http://gruntjs.com/](http://gruntjs.com/)
	- Build tool for minimising, running and tests
  - `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- PhantomJS - [http://phantomjs.org/](http://phantomjs.org/) Version: 1.9.7-15
	- Headless webkit for running tests
- Cordova-icon and Cordova-splash - [https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-icon/](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-icon/) and [https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-splash/](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-splash/)
  - `npm install -g cordova-icon` and `npm install -g cordova-splash`

## Getting started

- clone the project
- cd into the project folder
- With commands:
  - `npm install` to install node_modules and js/css components (`npm install` will also run `bower install`).
  - `cordova platform add ios` and/or `cordova platform add android`
  - `cordova-icon && cordova-splash`
- With script:
  - iOS: `./build.sh ios`
  - Android: `./build.sh android`
  - Desktop: `./build.sh desktop`

## Build Encryptr

- iOS: `./build.sh ios`
- Android: `./build.sh android`
- Desktop: `./build.sh desktop`
- All platforms: `./build.sh desktop ios android`

## First test

To make sure everything is set up from the above, run your first tests:

   `grunt test`

See the output for the steps taken to produce the working test rig. Most of the steps have `grunt` commands you can use to do them individually.

## Workflow

JavaScript files are in `src`. They are kept out of the www tree so that they can be linted without trying to lint the concatenated and minified versions. However, the index.html should have a script tag only for the JavaScript files in either `components` (managed by Bower) or `www/js`.

Building and testing the project is normally done via the Grunt tasks below.

## Grunt tasks

We use `grunt` commands to do most of the project operations, like:

* running the app:
  * ios: `grunt debug:ios`
  * Android: `grunt debug:android`

* testing: `grunt test`
* linting the sources: `grunt jshint`
* concatenating the sources: `grunt concat`
* compiling the templates: `grunt dot`

See the steps taken for `grunt test` and `grunt debug:XXX` for the various operations needed to constitute the working app, and look at Gruntfile.js for the whole repertoire.
